# Depression Post Classification Using Reddit Data

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning classifier to determine whether posts on Reddit originate from depression-related communities. By leveraging the community structure of Reddit subreddits, we classify posts as either related to depression or not, using data from depression-focused subreddits as the target.

## Objectives
*	To classify Reddit posts based on their likelihood of originating from communities focused on depression.
*	To experiment with various machine learning models to enhance classification accuracy, specifically targeting mental health-related discourse.

## Approach
1.	Data Collection: Gathered text data from Reddit posts across various subreddits, particularly focusing on depression-centered communities.
2.	Feature Extraction: Used text from the posts as input features.
3.	Model Selection: Experimented with multiple machine learning architectures:
    -	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    -	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    -	Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
    -	Transformers
4.	Classification Goal: Designed to predict which posts are likely to come from depression-related subreddits, making the model useful for classifying mental health-related content, with an emphasis on depressive discourse.

## Results
By comparing these models, the project aimed to identify a robust classifier that accurately distinguishes depression-related content, with potential applications in mental health analysis and content moderation.
